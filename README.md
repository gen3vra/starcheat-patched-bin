[Click here](https://github.com/gen3vra/starcheat-patched-bin/releases) to go download the latest release.

### About
The asset loading and character parsing have been updated and fixed. Load speeds for the characters are magnitudes faster than previous versions. Beyond that, tons of other changes have been made and are planned.

This is the only official release distribution source of Starcheat and all Starcheat.net builds. Do **not** download from anywhere else for safety and always check the file download hash if you want.
