[Click here](https://github.com/gen3vra/starcheat-patched-bin/releases) to go download the latest release.

### About
The asset loading and character parsing have been fixed. Load speeds for the characters are magnitudes faster than previous versions. Beyond that, misc changes and patches have been added along the way.

This is the only official release distribution source of Starcheat and all Starcheat.net builds. Do **NOT** download from anywhere else for safety and always check the file download hash if you're paranoid.
