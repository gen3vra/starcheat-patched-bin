#### What's going on here?
Hi, my name is Gen. I'm a software engineer who used to be a big fan of Starbound and the mod community in general and recently decided to fix starcheat because I needed an easy way to inject items into my character and didn't want to start from scratch.

I fixed the asset loading and character parsing, and in my tests some load speeds for the characters are magnitudes faster, but you will have to see for yourself and let me know.

If you want anything else fixed, please be sure to let me know, I only use the item editor, so I'm not sure about ship settings, quests, character editor, etc. If anything is seriously broken I will fix it, so [make sure to shoot me a message](https://gmr.dev#contact).
